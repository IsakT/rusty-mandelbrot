# rusty-mandelbrot
My implementation of the Mandelbrot set in Rust. I got the idea after seeing a buggy and non-working implementation of this algorithm in the book Rust In Action. 

The bugs in its implementation have been fixed, code refactored and reworked from scratch, and each step of the algorithm has been extensively commented. This is how it should have been in the book.

To render locally in your terminal, simply pull this repo, and then run:

```
# navigate to project
cd rusty_mandelbrot

# install cargo and rust compiler
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

# run program
cargo run
```
